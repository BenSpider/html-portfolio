<h1>The Best Movies According to Ven</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
       <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/"> <img src="../assets/images/Matrix Neo.png"></a>
<p>This is my favorite movie of all time. As the famous quote goes, Matrix is not a movie, it is a documentary.</p>

<h3>Star Wars</h3>
    <a href="https://www.starwars.com/films"?><img src="../assets/images/Star Wars Luke.png"></a>
<p>It wasn't a favotie movie of mine until my son was born on May the 4th. Now I just like the movie without knowing its content</p>
<h3>The Groundhog Day</h3>
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/"><img src="../assets/images/Groundhog day.png"/></a>
<p> Although this movie feels like a comedy, there is a deep spiritual message in it. It is that you have to deal with your shit and get your life stright, or you will carry them on to your next life</p>
